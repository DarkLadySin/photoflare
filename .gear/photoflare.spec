%description
This is an effort to bring quick, simple but powerful image editing to the
masses. Photoflare is inspired by the image editor currently only available
on Microsoft Windows â€“ PhotoFiltre. However, it will not be a straight clone.
It is being built from the ground up to be much improved and cross platform too!
